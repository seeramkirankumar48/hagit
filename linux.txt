In linux there are 3 types of users are there::
1.super user(root)
//to install software perform any administrative tasks
2.regular user
//all the regular profiles are created under the home directory
3.service user
//different s/w's can run with the different service user permissions.

-->In linux we can have 2 files with same name provided those  two have different case names.
ex::test,Test

-->when there are 2 regular user profiles in home directory you cannot access the other user profile,In order to access this you can use su command
su--super user
