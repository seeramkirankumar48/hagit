what is pure functions?
a.the function output will solely depend on the input.
b.the function inputs cannot be changed.
c.the function doesn't have any side effects.

what are function side effects?
the function side effects are those in which the function may not alter any variables that are out of scope of that particular function.
ex: a function updating a global variable, and we cannot predict the output of these variables.

what are the benefits of pure functions?
a.the pure functions are safe.
b.the output of pure functions is always same for the valid inputs at any time.
c.we can use these functions as function composition(chaining of functions).

what is meant by first class functions?
//The first class functions should satisfy these three conditions.
a.the function can be assigned to an variable (the functions can be used as an variables).
b.the function can be passed to an another function(HigherOrder functions).
c.The function can be an return value.
