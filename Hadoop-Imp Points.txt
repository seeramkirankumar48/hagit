1. There is no concept of data locality concept for reduce tasks.
2.when a mapreduce job is submitted to the Rm there will be 3 types of counters will be generated which will let us know the statistics of the job.
a.FileSystem Counters:
	Number of bytes read
	Number of bytes written
b.Job counters:
	Launched map tasks
	Launched reduce tasks
	data local map tasks
c.mapreduce Framework:
	map input records
	map output records
	reduce input records
	reduce output records
	combine input records
	combine output records

ex::File System Counters
		FILE: Number of bytes read=2543845574
		FILE: Number of bytes written=3826255597
		FILE: Number of read operations=0
		FILE: Number of large read operations=0
		FILE: Number of write operations=0
		HDFS: Number of bytes read=726684326
		HDFS: Number of bytes written=1263585345
		HDFS: Number of read operations=21
		HDFS: Number of large read operations=0
		HDFS: Number of write operations=2
	Job Counters

		WRONG_MAP=0
		WRONG_REDUCE=0
	File Input Format Counters 
		Bytes Read=726683648
	File Output Format Counters 
		Bytes Written=1263585345

3.There are in total 5 configuration files::
a.hadoop-env.sh
sets the hadoop specific configuration files here.typically the java_home and other configurations such as HADOOP_HOME & HADOOP_CLASSPATH which are set in the bashrc file are used in this file.
b.core-site.xml

c.hdfs-site.xml
d.mapred-site.xml
e.yarn-site.xml
